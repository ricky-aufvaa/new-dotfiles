## Changelog
Init and v1.0.0: These update are the inital commits and bug fixes to the code. They cover a lot of the features meant to be in the config but not all of them.

v2.0.0: This update is a massive overhaul to the code. This fixes bugs and adds support for a customized private browsing page. You will need to have the assets firefox_halo_with_paw_private.png and firefox_halo_with_paw_private_favicon.png downloaded and in the same location as userChrome.css and userContent.css for this update to work as intended. The others do not need to be downloaded but having them linked here may soon become a legacy feature. When it comes out, v2.5.0 will organize the code in an order that makes more sense.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
v2.1.0 & v2.1.1: This probably destroyed everyone who was using this before this update's experience. If that's you, I'm sorry, I had to redo some structuring. 

v2.1.1 resolved some minor bugs.

v2.2.0: This update resolved some very minor bugs and changed some image file names

v3.0.0: v3.0.0 adds a lot. It adds 40 various bookmark icons specially made to match the style and color of Firefox Halo. There are far too many to show here, so peak inside of the icons folder.
